# Task Manager Application

A simple task management application built with React that allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks. This project demonstrates basic state management, list rendering, form handling, and localStorage usage. Additionally, it includes an advanced drag-and-drop feature for reordering tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks by entering text and submitting through a form.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list by clicking the delete button.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Mark tasks as completed with a checkbox and visually differentiate them.
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**: Reorder tasks using drag-and-drop functionality for enhanced task organization.

## Learning Points

- **State Management (`useState`)**: Manage the state of tasks and their status.
- **List Rendering (`map`)**: Render a list of tasks dynamically using `map`.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Display tasks and controls (delete, complete) based on their state.
- **Form Handling**: Capture and process form input to add new tasks to the task list.
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Persist task data across page reloads by storing and retrieving tasks using `localStorage`.
